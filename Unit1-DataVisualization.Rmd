# Unit Format

This Unit contains 4 lesson modules: Introduction, Think Outside the Box (Parts 1 and 2), and Applying the Tools. You will learn the history of data visualization, how to imagine new ways of the genre, and apply your new skills to your own life.

**Unit Learning Objectives:**

Students in this unit will:

1. Learn and understand the often untaught background and history of data visualization.
2. Analyze both the historical and contemporary components that make up "bad" data visualization.
3. Examine the impact of emotion in visualization and how it affects the user.
4. Create data visualizations using data relevant to Cal Poly and their own life.

# Lesson 1: Introduction

## Background

What do you think of when you hear the words **"graph"** and **"data visualization"**?

In the field of statistics, communication is everything. Communicating the results we achieve won't mean much if we cannot explain to others whatever it is we found!

Communication can take many forms: reports, presentation slides, talks, you name it!

But today, we will focus on one form of statistical communication: **Data Visualization**

Do your data visualizations have to look like this? Maybe not now, but you'll get there!

## A Short History of Data Visualization

Here's a link: <https://towardsdatascience.com/a-short-history-of-data-visualisation-de2f81ed0b23>.

While reading the above article, walk through some questions below.

1. What does the article describe as some of the earliest types of data visualization? What other possible types of early data visualization can you come up with?

2. Talk about 3 of the early pioneers of data visualization that are mentioned in this article and what set their styles apart.

3. What innovation led to the rise of spreadsheets and more automated editing, formatting, and updating of tables?


While the field of data visualization now may seem very technical and built for the modern era, the above examples show that that is not necessarily the case. In fact, historical figures you wouldn't associate with statistics/data tried their hand (very successfully!) with infographics and visualization.

Here's a link: <https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/first-time-together-and-color-book-displays-web-du-bois-visionary-infographics-180970826/>. Take a look at some examples of Du Bois' work and pick your favorite infographic of his. Why does it appeal to you? What are some things you notice?


While we have learned that visualizations can be very useful, there is also the bad side.


## Bad Visualization

You have already learned about some of the features that make data visualization "bad": the diagrams are unclear, the graphs are too cluttered, the formatting and colors are off. In this section, we will explore these areas more and examine **why** certain stylistic choices aren't ideal.

Here's a link: <https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/counter_intuitive.html>.

Here's a video:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x-rDVXVwW9s" frameborder="0"allowfullscreen></iframe>

While reading the above article and watching the video, walk through the question below.

1. The article and video list examples of ways a data visualization can become counter-intuitive and/or misleading. Can you come up with other ways in which data visualization can be misleading? Work with your partner to brainstorm ideas and look for an example of a bad infographic that exemplifies your chosen aspect.


As data visualization continues to grow as a field, experts set rules for what makes a visualization good or bad, useful or misleading, etc. One contentious aspect of the field is how to incorporate emotion in graphs and visualization work. For "homework," please read the linked article here and make notes on what the author regards as the downsides and dangers of incorporating emotion in data visualization.

Here's a link: <https://businessesgrow.com/2020/08/05/data-is-dangerous/>.

> KEY LESSON TAKEAWAYS: Data visualization as we know it today is not a new phenomenon; it is the culmination and continuation of years of work and artistry. We have also learned that while data visualization can be a very powerful tool, there are many instances of misuse that we should be wary of.

# Lesson 2: Think Outside the Box (Part 1)

What did you learn from the article for "homework"?

Please discuss with your group some of your key takeaways from the article!

## The Power of Emotion: Gun Deaths Data

Is data neutral? Can data ever truly be neutral?

Emotion has long been something that is avoided in data/data visualization work because of the fear that emotion skews the audience perception of the conclusions that can be drawn from the data at hand. In other words, a data visualization should speak for itself and not attempt to influence a reader or viewer in any way.

What do **you** think about this?

Here's a link: <https://www.wired.com/2013/02/periscopic-gun-statistic-visualization/>.

Here's another link: <https://vizworld.com/2013/09/gun-deaths-infographics-emotional-storytelling/>.

While reading the above articles, walk through some questions below.

1. You have learned previously that the more "cluttered" a data visualization is, the more confusing and unclear it is, and therefore the worse overall it is. In what ways do the things you learn from these articles challenge that?

2. In what ways are data visualizations related to storytelling? Why would these connections be relevant with regards to emotion?

One of the most fascinating aspects of the Periscopic gun data visualization is how it shows all of the data at once while still allowing the user to examine individual points/lives that are being described. By providing context to the data, the makers of the data visualization use emotion to tell a real story that brings the whole infographic to life and makes it resonate that much more strongly.

## The Power of Emotion: Evictions Data

In the previous data, you have seen an example of how bringing emotion to the graphic can bring out strong feelings and thoughts. Here is another example which, while seemingly messier, still accomplishes similar goals. Think about both the similarities and differences between the previous data visualization and this one.

The types of emotions your data visualization can bring out!

Here's a link: <http://www.antievictionmappingproject.net/narratives.html>.

While reading the above article, walk through some questions below.

1. In what other ways have you learned previously might this data visualization be considered "messy" or "bad"?

2. How does the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project employ other mediums in their infographic to tell their story?

3. Can you count the number of evictions in this data visualization? If not, does that mean this data visualization is doing its job? Why or why not?

Data visualization allows us to tell stories. Sometimes, those stories consist of numbers and numerical summaries of the data we have collected. Other times however, such as in this case, data visualization serves to prove a point by using emotion and connecting the data back to its real life context (by including interviews in this case).

Here's a link: <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/08/emotional.pdf>.

Here's another link: <https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street>.

For "homework," please read the above article in the first link and write a 200-word summary of the material. With the second link, explore the data however you like and come to the next class meeting, ready to tell the story of any one family you "meet."

**THIS ASSIGNMENT CAN BE CHANGED. THE ALTERNATIVE IS BELOW**

For "homework," work with your partner/group to brainstorm and search for other "emotional" datasets. You need not create any initial data viz (although highly encouraged!), but please come ready to present on your dataset and any ideas you have on data vizzes you might be able to create from there.

> KEY LESSON TAKEAWAYS: We have been told that data is neutral, and that emotion has no place in a scientific field like statistics and data visualization. However, there is power in emotion and our ability to tell stories and communicate data with that emotion. We also see the power in learning the stories behind our data and the emotions that come from that.

# Lesson 3: Think Outside the Box (Part 2)

## Physical Data Visualization

Let's revisit a question from the beginning of this unit: What do you think of when you hear the words **"graph"** and **"data visualization"**?

We have learned a bit more about the possibilities for data visualization and expanding the traditional definitions and formats to include emotion. Can we push the boundaries even further?

Here's a link: <http://dataphys.org/list/>.

While reading the above article, walk through some questions below.

1. Choose 3 visualizations from this list that appealed to you most. Why did they appeal to you? What sets these visualizations apart?

2. What does it mean for a data visualization to be interactive? Find an example in the list of physical data visualizations of an interactive one. Explain how it is interactive and what might set it apart from other "static" visualizations.

Some examples you'll see of physical data visualization

Here's a link: <https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01120152/document>.

For "homework," please read the above article and make notes.

> KEY LESSON TAKEAWAYS: Data visualization seems to be in the domain of programming, coding, and online visuals these days; but, we can expand that defintion further. Physical data visualizations have been around since some of the earliest days of human civilization up until the current day. They provide another dimension and way we can explore data.
